# Phase-Wise Shapley Credit Assignment in MARL (MAPPO Framework)

This repository extends the official [MAPPO framework](https://github.com/marlbenchmark/on-policy) with a novel **phase-wise Shapley value credit assignment method** for addressing the **credit assignment and interpretability problem** in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL).  

Our approach decomposes agent credit assignment along the **temporal dimension** of an episode, computes **Shapley-based credit per phase**, and then aggregates credits with a **temporal decay mechanism**. This allows more interpretable and robust training compared to uniform or shallow credit distribution.

## üöÄ Motivation

- Standard MARL methods (COMA, VDN, QMIX) distribute rewards uniformly or with shallow credit signals.  
- They fail to capture **long-term dependencies** and **temporally extended cooperative tasks**.  
- Our method:  
  - Segments trajectories into **phases** (e.g., exploration ‚Üí collaboration ‚Üí execution).  
  - Computes **Shapley credit** within each phase.  
  - Aggregates with **temporal decay weighting**.  

This provides **interpretability** (phase-credit heatmaps), **credit fidelity**, and better **training efficiency**.

## üìñ Method Overview

1. **Phase Segmentation**
   - Reward change-points  
   - State thresholds  
   - Learned change-point detection  
   - Fixed time windows (fallback)  

2. **Phase-wise Shapley Credit Assignment**
   - Approximate Shapley values with Monte Carlo sampling / truncated permutations  

3. **Temporal Decay Aggregation**
   - Weight credits across phases using exponential decay or learnable weights  

4. **Policy Integration**
   - Use shaped advantages in MAPPO (on-policy gradient)

## üìä Example Results

Below are TensorBoard logs from basic experiments (MPE environments).  

| Agent Training | Credit Assignment | Phase Analysis |
|----------------|------------------|----------------|
| ![agent0](shap_log1.png) | ![credit](shap_log2.png) | ![phases](shap_log3.png) |
| ![agent1](shap_log5.png) | ![agent2](shap_log6.png) |   |

Results show **clear phase-level decomposition** and **improved interpretability** of agent contributions.
